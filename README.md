# Image-Classifier-Using-Keras-and-Tensorflow

This project is part of my learning and practice process in Machine Learning and Deep Learning Modelling. Here I used Keras and Tensorflow in building
and Image Classifier Model which classifies between Happy and Sad People. 

My Learning Outcomes in this project were the following: 

Built a Data Pipeline
Preprocessed Images for Deep Learning
Created a Deep Neural Network Classifier
Evaluated Model Performance
Saved Model for Deployment

At the end of this project, I fed the model with new images of happy and sad people and the model predicted with an accuracy of 99%.
